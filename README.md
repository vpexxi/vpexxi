## 🚀 What I Do

* **Back-end**: Spring Boot, REST APIs, microservices.
* **Front-end**: React, Flexbox layouts, responsive UI.
* **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), AWS (S3, Lambda).
* **Testing & CI/CD**: JUnit, GitHub Actions.

## 💼 Featured Projects

### 📚 React OpenLibrary BookList

A **React** single-page application that fetches and displays a list of books from the Open Library API. Demonstrates live search, click-to-select highlighting with reordering, and a responsive, Flexbox-powered layout with a fixed header.

#### Highlights

* Developed the execution module with a microservice backend and a React frontend for secure execution management and real-time event-driven communication.
* Built RESTful APIs to handle FIX messages, ensuring reliable event-driven communication across distributed services.
* Designed and optimized MySQL schemas and implemented Redis caching for logout and refresh token management to improve performance.
* Created frontend components with React and Redux to manage execution records and display real-time execution details for improved UX.
* Engineered Kafka-based asynchronous execution reporting using AVRO/JSON schemas, decoupling services to enhance scalability and throughput.
* Implemented a FIX-message ingestion pipeline with QuickFIX/J and Spring Boot to parse, validate, and normalize incoming trades.
* Architected a resilient microservices framework using Spring Cloud Eureka & Ribbon for service discovery, load balancing, and zero-downtime failover.
* Secured execution endpoints with Spring Security, OAuth 2.0 (JWT), and role-based access control for granular permissions.
* Designed execution validation logic to enforce data integrity through field constraints and dependency checks.

#### Tech Stack & Tools

Java, Spring Boot (MVC, Data JPA/Hibernate, Security, Cloud), QuickFIX/J, Apache Kafka (AVRO/JSON), MySQL, Redis, React, Next.js, Redux, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), Jenkins, Maven, Git, JUnit, Mockito, JaCoCo
