# Hi, I’m Jun Zhou 👋

#### Aspiring Software Engineer • Java | Python | React

I build distributed backend services, interactive web apps, and ML-based tools that solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 What I Do

* **Back‑end**: Design and implement microservices and RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, QuickFIX/J, and Kafka.
* **Front‑end**: Build responsive, state‑managed UIs using React, Redux, and Next.js.
* **ML & Data**: Develop and deploy TensorFlow models (EfficientNetB0) for image classification tasks.
* **DevOps & Cloud**: Containerize with Docker, orchestrate with Kubernetes (EKS), and leverage AWS services (S3, Lambda).
